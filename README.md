üé¨ Movies Data Engineering Take-Home Test

üìò Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering workflow ‚Äî from data modeling to ETL and analytics ‚Äî using a dataset containing movie information and ratings.

The objectives are to:
    1. Design a conceptual and logical data model for movies and related entities.
    2. Implement the model in a relational database (PostgreSQL).
    3. Build an ETL pipeline to ingest the provided movies.csv dataset.
    4. Write analytical SQL queries (and optional views) to answer business questions.

üß† Data Model Design

Conceptual Model
The conceptual model defines high-level entities and their relationships:
    ‚Ä¢ Movie ‚Üí central entity containing core metadata (title, year range, gross, rating, stars)
    ‚Ä¢ Genre ‚Üí multiple genres per movie (many-to-many)
    ‚Ä¢ Director ‚Üí one or more directors per movie
    ‚Ä¢ Actor ‚Üí one or more actors per movie


Logical / Physical Model
Main table example:

CREATE TABLE movies_app.movie (
    movie_id      SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title         TEXT NOT NULL,
    year_start    INT,
    year_end      INT,
    rating        TEXT,
    gross         NUMERIC(14,2),
    runtime_min   INT,
    description   TEXT,
    raw_row       JSONB,
    created_at    TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);

üìÖ Why year_start and year_end
The year field in the dataset sometimes shows a range (For Series) ‚Äî for example:

The Walking Dead,(2010‚Äì2022)

To represent both movies and TV series accurately:
    ‚Ä¢ year_start stores the year of release.
    ‚Ä¢ year_end stores the final year (nullable for movies).


üîÑ ETL Flow
The ETL script (etl_load_data.py) performs the following steps:

1. Extract
    ‚Ä¢ Reads movies.csv using pandas.
    ‚Ä¢ Normalizes text encodings and removes whitespace.

2. Transform
    ‚Ä¢ Cleans malformed characters (e.g., √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú ‚Üí ‚Äì).
    ‚Ä¢ Parses year field into year_start and year_end.
    ‚Ä¢ Converts numeric columns (gross, runtime) into consistent types.
    ‚Ä¢ Optionally stores the raw row as JSON for traceability.

3. Load
    ‚Ä¢ Connects to PostgreSQL via psycopg2 or SQLAlchemy.
    ‚Ä¢ Creates tables if not exist (using create_tables.sql).
    ‚Ä¢ Loads cleaned records into movies_app.movie.


üßÆ Analytical Queries

    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT title) AS unique_titles FROM movies_app.movie;

    JOIN movies_app.movie_actor ma ON ma.movie_id = m.movie_id
    JOIN movies_app.actor a ON a.actor_id = ma.actor_id

(4c) The name of the director and total gross of the films that have been directed.
    SELECT d.name AS director_name, SUM(m.gross) AS total_gross
    FROM movies_app.director d
    JOIN movies_app.movie_director md ON md.director_id = d.director_id
    JOIN movies_app.movie m ON m.movie_id = md.movie_id
    GROUP BY d.name
    ORDER BY total_gross DESC NULLS LAST;

(4d) Top 5 comedy films by gross
    SELECT m.title, m.year_start AS year_of_release, m.rating, m.gross
    FROM movies_app.movie m
    JOIN movies_app.movie_genre mg ON mg.movie_id = m.movie_id
    JOIN movies_app.genre g ON g.genre_id = mg.genre_id
    WHERE LOWER(g.name) = LOWER('comedy')
    ORDER BY m.gross DESC NULLS LAST
    LIMIT 5;

(4e) Films directed by Martin Scorsese starring Robert De Niro
    SELECT DISTINCT m.title, m.year_start AS year_of_release, m.rating
    FROM movies_app.movie m
    JOIN movies_app.movie_director md ON md.movie_id = m.movie_id
    JOIN movies_app.director d ON d.director_id = md.director_id
    JOIN movies_app.movie_actor ma ON ma.movie_id = m.movie_id
    JOIN movies_app.actor a ON a.actor_id = ma.actor_id
    WHERE LOWER(d.name) = LOWER('Martin Scorsese')
    AND LOWER(a.name) = LOWER('Robert De Niro')
    ORDER BY m.year_start;


üßæ Execution Flow
Model Design: Review conceptual ERD ‚Üí create SQL schema.
Database Setup: Run model/ddl_postgres.sql.
Data Load: Execute etl/etl_load_movies.py to insert data.
Validation: Check record counts and sample data in DB by running tests/data_quality_checks.sql.
Analytics: Run queries in queries/*.
(Optional) Deploy stored procedures/views for recurring reports.
